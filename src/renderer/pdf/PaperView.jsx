// PaperView — the "Paper" pane: a PDF drawn page by page with pdf.js, each page one white
// sheet, rough.js zigzag highlights and Caveat handwritten notes. Port of
// the design's syncPdf / pdfMouseUp / freeWidth / pendingSelKey / addMark / renderMarks
// (design/goal-canvas/Goal Canvas.dc.html lines 516–602), with two changes: marks are stored in
// page units (fractions of the page's drawn width) so they survive a re-layout at another zoom,
// and the document is parsed once and only re-laid-out on zoom or resize.
// Zoom follows the "Stage" design (Add - Mention Stage.dc.html, 2026-09-23), with 100% = fit width
// (Hudson, 2026-09-23: "I want fit width for 100%"): at 100% the first page is exactly as wide as the
// pane, and every zoom is that width times the percentage, so a resized pane keeps its zoom and
// redraws. Pages are centered with no gutter of their own; a floating bar at the bottom shows the
// page and zoom; a pinch (or ⌘ / ⌃ scroll) zooms around the pointer.
// `target` (2026-09-30): a passage a link asked for. Once every page's text is drawn it is found from page 1, scrolled to and
// shown as a section (showSection), and told through onTarget(text, result); once per target, until the prop is cleared
// and given again. Nothing matching leaves the scroll where it is. `targetTo` (@discover round 2): the first words of the
// section after it; the stretch from the passage to just before them, up to six pages on, is tinted (SECTION), else the
// passage alone is. The section is find's no longer (2026-10-03, the Stage's Sections menu): it stays while find
// searches and stops, until another is shown or clearSection(). `initialSection` { find, to }: the section to show the
// same way when the viewer opens with no target (a tab with a guide's sections come to the front again). Never ink.
// A margin note mentions library items (MATH-21, 2026-10-05): `@` in it opens the @ menu (`mentionItems`, the workspace's
// list, of which only library rows are kept, and Bart at the start of a highlight's note: MATH-27), and a pick writes
// `@[Name](lib:<id>)` into the note (model/doc.js libMention).
// A note no one is typing in is shown as text (`data-note-view`), its mentions links: a click on one is
// `onOpenMention(id)`, a click anywhere else in it gives the note its field back, the caret where it was clicked. Its
// names are the library's now (`library`), so a renamed item shows its new name; one gone from the library is grey. With
// no `onOpenMention` a note is its field alone, as before: the token reads as typed.
// A library folder in the note's @ menu opens in place (MATH-22, with `listFolder`), as in a document, and a file in it is
// written `@[Name](lib:<folderId>:<path>)` (model/doc.js fileMention): its chip is clicked to `onOpenFile({ folderId,
// rel, name })`, and drawn grey when `fileState(folderId, rel)` says it is gone.
// The page as a canvas (MATH-27 phase 1, 2026-10-06; the pure parts are ./canvas.js). Every page lies on a desk at least
// DESK desk px wide each side (scaled with the page since the true canvas, below), that a box moved past its edge widens.
// Every note is a box with a grip (no border, 2026-10-06): a highlight's note opens on the desk beside it (its `side`), a double-click on blank space (a click
// until 2026-10-06) makes a free note there, and dragging the grip moves either (`pos`, page units, saved on drop); a click in its text edits it. Each
// answer Bart gave from a highlight's note (`asks`) is a box under the note, joined by a short line, moved the same way.
// Boxes that were not moved are spaced on every draw (canvas.js spaceBoxes), never saved. A note on a highlight that
// starts with @bart asks on Enter (`onAsk`; Shift+Enter is a new line), and a second one continues the exchange (its
// `asks` go as the turns). An answer being written (`pendingAsks`, the workspace's) is a box of its own until it lands
// (`addAsk`, from the Stage). Space-drag or a middle-drag pans; a fade says where boxes are out of view. Since 2026-10-07
// (David) there is no chip ("2 notes →") with it, and the bar has no Fit page or Fit page + notes.
// Follow-ups (2026-10-06): the boxes hanging under a moved one widen the desk as it does (canvas.js deskNeed), while it is
// dragged too; @bart from a part of a selection across pages sends the whole passage (./marks.js passageOf), and so does
// Continue in workspace; a deleted answer comes back with ⌘Z (undoKey) and stays a turn of its exchange, so the next
// question goes on in the same session (canvas.js exchangeOf); Space, ⌘Z and a pending selection's keys are the paper's
// only while nothing has the keyboard (keyFree).
// Second pass (2026-10-06): a box being written is filled in place as Bart works (fillRun), its Stop and "▸ steps" the
// same buttons throughout, so a click on one is not lost to the next tick; an answer that is here already is not added
// again (addAsk: main tells every window how an ask ended, the one that asked too).
// A true canvas (MATH-27 follow-up, 2026-10-06): what is drawn on the desk scales with the page. Boxes and the
// lines joining them are laid out in desk px (./canvas.js: the px of 100%) on each sheet's notes layer, and
// that layer is scaled by the page's zoom (`k`, geo[n].k: the layout's zoom), so at 200% a note is 480px wide, its
// type twice as big and its gap from the page twice as wide, and a box keeps its place against the page's text at every
// zoom, moved or not. The desk is DESK desk px a side, k times as wide in a layout. A pinch scales what is drawn, and
// the drawing that follows puts every box where the pinch left it; a free note keeps the width it was measured at until
// the page's text is there to measure it again (freeW). The zoom bar, the chips, the fades and the @ menu stay screen-sized.
// One card a highlight (MATH-27 follow-up, 2026-10-06): a highlight's note and Bart's answers to it are one card, like a
// comment thread, ASK_W wide throughout: the note at the top, then each answer and each answer being written, split by a
// thin divider (cardBox). Nothing joins them now. The card moves by its one grip (the mark's `pos`); an answer moved on
// its own before is shown in its card, its `pos` no longer read. An answer's grey question shows only when it is not what
// the note asks now (canvas.js askedByNote). A question carries the page's text around the passage (pageTextAround), a
// selection snaps out to whole words (snapWords), and a card leaves its highlight's margin only as a last resort
// (marks.js NOTE_SLACK).
// Blank space and @bart (MATH-27 follow-up, 2026-10-06): a drag from blank space (the desk, or the page further than
// a line, canvas.js LINE, from its text) pans as Space-drag does, and one on or near text selects as before (pointAt); a
// click there only puts the focus and a pending selection away, and a double-click writes a free note. The cursor is a hand
// over blank space (syncCursor). A free note left empty goes when it loses the keyboard and is never saved (canvas.js
// keptMarks). A highlight's card has no arrow to it (taken out again on 2026-10-06, as MATH-15 had it).
// @bart at the start of a note that can ask is the document's blue
// label, in the note shown and, through a backdrop under its transparent text, in its field (model/doc.js noteInkHtml).
// Removing a mark (MATH-66, 2026-10-06): Backspace / Delete on the mark in focus (a highlight pressed, or a card's grip:
// the card's trash button went 2026-10-07, David), nothing having the keyboard, takes the mark away, every part of a
// selection across pages with it, and an answer still being written on it is stopped first (removeMark). No confirmation:
// a toast says so for about 5 s with Undo, and ⌘Z does the same, the mark coming back where it was with its note, answers
// and place (undoRemoval).
