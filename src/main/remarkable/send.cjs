// Send to reMarkable (2026-10-31): a PDF from Engelbart onto the tablet, the way reMarkable supports without its cloud
// or a cable: the official reMarkable app on this Mac imports a file and syncs it to the tablet.
//
// The PDF is copied under the name it should have on the tablet (the app names a document after its file), the app is
// brought up and given the file (macOS's open), and its library (packages/remarkable-bridge's desktop source, the one
// Connect reads) is watched for a new document of that name. The app does not say whether it takes files this way, so
// when nothing has come after WAIT_MS the answer is `drop`: the window offers the file to drag into the app, which is
// the way reMarkable documents, and the library is watched again (awaitDrop) until it comes. Nothing else is written
// anywhere: the reMarkable app does the importing.
//
// What the app makes of it is a document of its own, which Connect would bring back into the library beside the PDF it
// came from: `expect(name)` (before the app is given it) and `arrived(entry)` tell ./sync.cjs, which leaves that copy
// out of the library for as long as nobody has written on it.
