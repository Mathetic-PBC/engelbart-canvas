// reMarkable (2026-10-31): the person's notebooks and annotated PDFs, as files in a library folder of Engelbart's.
//
// Read from the library the official reMarkable app keeps on this Mac (packages/remarkable-bridge findDesktopLibrary:
// ~/Library/Containers/com.remarkable.desktop/…), never from reMarkable's cloud, whose terms forbid other software,
// and never over USB. Nothing is written back there. Connecting needs only that app installed and signed in; macOS
// asks the person once whether Engelbart may read another app's data.
//
// The mirror, <dataRoot>/.remarkable/ (a dot folder: a project is <dataRoot>/<slug>, and one named "reMarkable" must
// never be this):
//   state.json   { v, connected, dir, syncedAt, items: { [id]: { kind, version, dir, base, files, convert } } }
//   library/     the tablet's folders as folders, each document as `<name>.pdf` (ink drawn in: ./convert.cjs) and
//                `<name>.md` (its typed text and highlights, when it has any); an ebook as its `.md` alone
// Each document is a row of the library of its own (./rows.cjs): its PDF (an ebook's `.md`), under its name on the
// tablet, so the library's search, the @ menu, the Stage's paper viewer, workspaces and Bart reach it as any paper.
// A row stays the same row while its document does, renamed or moved on the tablet.
//
// A sync lists the app's library (a stat per file after the first) and converts only documents whose files changed
// since (Entry.version), in a worker thread. A document put in the tablet's trash (or in a folder put there) has its
// copy deleted. One the app simply stops listing is kept, where it was: without a Connect subscription reMarkable's
// cloud, and so its app, keeps only what was used in the last 50 days, and a notebook that ages out must not vanish
// from Engelbart too (nor everything, should the app be signed out). It comes back as itself if the app lists it again. Names: the tablet's, made safe for a file name; two in one folder with the same name are
// "Name" and "Name (2)", and a document keeps the name it was given for as long as it keeps its own. A document that
// cannot be converted keeps its files from before, is named on the row, and is tried again when it changes or once in
// the next run of the app. A PDF nobody wrote on is cloned, not rewritten (./convert.cjs).
// A PDF sent from Engelbart (./send.cjs) comes back as a document of its own: while nobody has written on it, it is
// the PDF it was sent from over again, and is left out of the library; once it has ink or highlights it comes in as the
// tablet's copy, beside the one it was sent from (the two do not merge). sent.json: which documents those are ({ ids:
// { [id]: at } }), and the names of ones on their way ({ pending: [{ key, at }] }, matched to the first new PDF of that
// name, kept a week). It stays through a disconnect, as rows.json does.
// When: on connecting, a little after launch, whenever the app's library changes (it is watched while connected; the
// reMarkable app writes there as the tablet syncs), when a window comes to the front after 2 minutes, and every
// 10 minutes. Never two at once; one asked for meanwhile runs after.
